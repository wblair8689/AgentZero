## Google Vertex AI Agent Engine Integration

Our architecture leverages key capabilities of Google's Vertex AI Agent Engine:

1. **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** - Used for the main Orchestrator Agent to efficiently manage workflows
2. **RAG Engine** - Integrated into the Product Research Agent for enhanced document retrieval and analysis
3. **Function Calling** - Implemented in the Sales Opportunity Agent for structured outputs and actions
4. **Tool Integration** - Connecting to Google Cloud services like BigQuery, Cloud Storage, and Google Search
5. **OpenTelemetry Tracing** - Applied to the Product Evaluation Agent for debugging and performance optimization

## Agent Architecture Description

Our architecture demonstrates Google Agent Engine capabilities through:

- **Orchestration Layer** - Central agent built with ADK manages the workflow and coordinates specialized agents
- **Specialized Agents** - Purpose-built agents that showcase different capabilities (RAG, grounding, function calling)
- **Tool Integration** - Agents connect to Google Cloud services (BigQuery, Cloud Storage) and external tools
- **Telemetry & Debugging** - OpenTelemetry tracing allows for efficient agent debugging and optimization
- **End-to-End Workflow** - Complete product research and recommendation flow demonstrates practical business application
