## Google Vertex AI Agent Engine Integration

Our architecture leverages key capabilities of Google's Vertex AI Agent Engine:

1. **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** - Used for the main Orchestrator Agent to efficiently manage workflows
2. **RAG Engine** - Integrated into the Product Research Agent for enhanced document retrieval and analysis
3. **Function Calling** - Implemented in the Sales Opportunity Agent for structured outputs and actions
4. **Tool Integration** - Connecting to Google Cloud services like BigQuery, Cloud Storage, and Google Search
5. **OpenTelemetry Tracing** - Applied to the Product Evaluation Agent for debugging and performance optimization

## Agent Architecture Description

Our architecture demonstrates Google Agent Engine capabilities through:

- **Orchestration Layer** - Central agent built with Vertex AI manages the workflow and coordinates specialized agents
- **Specialized Agents** - Purpose-built agents that showcase different capabilities (RAG, grounding, function calling)
- **Tool Integration** - Agents connect to Google Cloud services (BigQuery, Cloud Storage) and external tools
- **Telemetry & Debugging** - Logging infrastructure allows for efficient agent debugging and optimization
- **End-to-End Workflow** - Complete product research and recommendation flow demonstrates practical business application

## CI/CD Pipeline Status
- Cloud Build integration active
- Configured for automated testing with Jest and Cucumber
- Updated dependencies to be compatible with Node.js 19 environment
- Optimized builder configuration to use compatible versions (Node.js 19 with Cucumber 9.6.0)
- Working on resolving deployment and testing pipeline issues (Build failed due to undefined Cucumber steps; added pending step definitions)

## Recent Development Updates
- Implemented Vertex Orchestration Agent with Google Cloud connectivity
- Created specialized agents for Product Research and Market Analysis
- Added integration tests with real Vertex AI API connections
- Implemented conversation context management for multi-turn interactions
- Added support for complete workflow orchestration across specialized agents

## Notes
- Refer to `Readme.txt` for technical notes and further instructions.
- Refer to `DEPLOYMENT.md` for deployment strategy details.
- Use `./get_logs.sh` to fetch logs for the most recent Cloud Build run.
- Update this checklist as development progresses.
