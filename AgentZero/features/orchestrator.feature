Feature: Orchestrator Agent Core Functionality

  As a user of the AgentZero system
  I want the Orchestrator Agent to manage workflows
  So that specialized agents can be coordinated effectively.

  Scenario: Placeholder Scenario (To be defined)
    Given the Orchestrator Agent is initialized
    When a new product research request is received
    Then the Orchestrator should delegate the task to the appropriate agent
